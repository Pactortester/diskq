"""
DiskQ is a Python package that provides persistent queues and stacks,
allowing users to store and retrieve data even after the program has terminated.
This is achieved by persistently storing the data on disk in pickle or dill format.
DiskQ supports three different types of queues: a regular queue, a priority queue, and a LIFO queue.
It's easy to use and can help with various scenarios where data needs to be stored in a persistent way.
